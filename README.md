## üìå Project Overview

The **Smart Walker System** combines hardware and software to create a smarter mobility aid. Key features include:
- üîç Obstacle detection using ultrasonic and d80NK
- ü§ï Fall detection using GY-521(MPU6050)+ Gyro
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-time alerts on Web Application and Line Notification
- üì± Mobile/Web dashboard for remote monitoring
- üîã Battery management and power efficiency

## üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard UI

A sample image of the Smart Walker system Dashboard UI, which displays real-time information such as:
- Heart Rate üíì
- Distance walked üö∂
- Number of steps üë£
- Active time during the month üìÖ
- Weekly distance and steps chart üìä
